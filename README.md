## Visualizing RStudio Logs

This is an attempt to create an interactive visualization of data from the RStudio download logs that they have generously shared with the R community. 

The current plot shows a map of downloads that took place on a single day, 2013-06-07. The points are colored based on the number of unique ip_id's that downloaded from a given country. If you click on any point, you will get a list of the top 5 packages in terms of number of downloads.

I hope to populate this repo with more interactive visualizations and also share the code so that you can reproduce the same.
